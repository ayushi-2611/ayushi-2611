# Hello, I'm Ayushi Gupta
# Software Engineer | Problem Solver | Debugging Enthusiast
### Every problem has a root cause. Every root cause has a fix. And that fix often starts with a few lines of clean, intentional code.

## About Me
I’m Ayushi — a Software Engineer who blends backend engineering + technical support + product thinking to build solutions that actually solve problems, not hide them.

I started out as a quiet, underconfident girl from a small town in India… and ended up mastering some of the loudest systems in tech:
	•	Java + Spring Boot
	•	SQL (PostgreSQL, Couchbase SQL)
	•	Python automation
	•	System debugging with Splunk, Datadog, New Relic  ￼
	•	ITIL & SDLC best practices  ￼

My journey is a mix of breaking production bugs, building backend systems, and teaching what I learn.

It’s messy. It’s beautiful. It’s me.

## 🔧 Technical Skills I Bring to the Table
### 💻 Core Skills
	•	Java • Spring Boot
	•	REST API Development
	•	SQL (PostgreSQL, Couchbase)
	•	Python (automation + analysis)
	•	System debugging & RCA
	•	Monitoring tools (Splunk, Datadog, New Relic)
	•	Incident Management (ITIL)
	•	Business logic development
### 📚 Currently Learning
	•	ReactJS
	•	CI/CD pipelines
	•	Scalable backend architecture

## ✨ Current Project: Employee Management System (Spring Boot)
I’m currently building a full backend Employee Management System designed for small-to-mid sized teams that struggle with tracking people-related workflows.

This project is more than just CRUD — it’s a real-world automation tool.

### 🔨 What I’m building:
	•	A complete REST API ecosystem
	•	PostgreSQL-backed data models
	•	Leave tracking
	•	Absence management
	•	Shift scheduling logic
	•	Clean authentication and structure
	•	Future addition: automated business rules (auto-approval, shift rotations)

### 💡 Why I’m building it
Most companies track employee availability manually or across multiple tools.
That leads to:
	•	Confusion
	•	Delays
	•	Errors
	•	Productivity dips

This system aims to centralize, automate, and simplify all of it — using the clean power of Spring Boot & SQL.

### ❤️ What excites me about this project
	•	Solving a real operational problem
	•	Designing maintainable business logic
	•	Writing APIs that feel intuitive to use
	•	Building something I can scale

## 🌱 My Purpose as an Engineer
I don’t just code for the sake of coding.
I code to reduce chaos, increase clarity, and give people their time back.

Why fix something every day
when automation can fix it forever?

Why react to failures
when you can design systems that avoid them?

Why accept complexity
when simple logic wins every time?

## 🎯 Explore My Work!
I intentionally removed the detailed “Projects” section
